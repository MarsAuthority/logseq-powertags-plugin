# Introduction

Designate selected tags as power tags, and see them auto-create properties are you use them!

# Usage

## Creating Power Tags

1. Create a power tag by first going to a block with a tag that you would like to convert to a power tag and using `/Create power tag`.
2. Insert the necessary properties that you would want to associate with this power tag.
3. Now the next time you use the tag, your properties will be auto-added.

## Managing Your Tags

1. Click on the `#` icon on your plugin toolbar.
2. You will see a list of your created power tags.
3. You can then:
   - Delete a power tag
     - This will not affect **past** blocks created with the tag
   - Delete a property of a power tag
     - This will apply to **past** and **future** blocks created with the tag
   - Add a property of a power tag
     - This will apply to **past** and **future** blocks created with the tag
   - Apply the properties of a power tag to blocks created before the power tag
     - This will apply to **past** blocks created before the power tag

> Important Note: Noted that the last 3 functions are irreversible so please ensure that your graph is backed up and that you are sure before applying them.
